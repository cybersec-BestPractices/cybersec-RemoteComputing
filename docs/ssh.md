## Keys Generation

### Basic SSH-Keys Generation
#### NIST's standard recommendations for ssh keys encryption algorithms
| Encryption Algorithm  | Key length | Key generation command |
|-----------------------|------------|------------------------|
| ECDSA, EdDSA, DH, MQV | f=224-255 (and above) | `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` |
| RSA                   | k=2048 (and above)    | `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` |


```sh
# generate keys using ed25519
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

# generate keys using rsa
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

```sh
# copying over keys to remote system
cat $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh USERNAME@remote.system.ip "cat >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys"
# alternatively one would use the ssh-copy-id command
ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub USERNAME@remote.system.ip
```

A typical output of the process of keys' generation would look like this,
```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/USERNAME/.ssh/id_ed25519): $HOME/.ssh/system1_id_ed25519
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  *******************************************
Enter same passphrase again:  *******************************************
Your identification has been saved in system1_id_ed25519.
Your public key has been saved in system1_id_ed25519.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:VrKTrH2EX+52KoKVbtIcPnzRlf21jo0vZU/Wf4IysjI local.USERNAME@local.machine
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|                 |
|                 |
|        . .    o |
|       . *    o o|
|        S.....  =|
|       +++.o.  +=|
|      .O..o...Boo|
|      E @.=.o+oo+|
|       =.* =oooo.|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

The next step would be to transfer the public part of recently generated key
to the remote system,
```sh
$ ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/system1_id_ed25519.pub USERNAME@remote.system.ip
```


## Keys Management
```sh
# transfer/copy keys to remote system
ssh-copy-id  -i $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  USERNAME@remote.system.ip

# use of an specific key to access clusterX
ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/USER_clusterX_ed25519 USERNAME@clusterX.IP.address

# use of an specific key to access clusterY
ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/USER_clusterY_ed25519 USERNAME@clusterY.IP.address

# use of an specific key for remote access to clusterZ
ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/USER_clusterZ_ed25519 USERNAME@clusterZ.IP.address
```



#### Adding Comments to your keys
One useful fearure offered by the key generation comamand is the capability to associate comments to key,
so that they can be used to remind us what a given key is being used fo
. Comments can be added to the key when created using the `-C` flag.
For instance,
```sh
# key generation with comments and specified location
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "USER@laptop cluster-X" -f $HOME/.ssh/USER_clusterX_ed25519
```
in this case, both the comment and the name for the keys files is being specified by
the respective `-C` and `-f` flags.
If one would like to modify the comment of an existent key, the `-c` (lower-case "c") flag can be used instead.


#### Using `ssh-agent` to remember your keys
Keys are quite powerful, they can substantially improve security and
efficiency at the moment of connecting to work in remote systems.
One really useful feature to help with productivity is requesting an
ssh-agent program to recall our keys/passphrases combinations,
in this way when a key is used to connect to a given system the
*ssh-agent* will remember the passphrase entered for a given period of time
avoiding to repeatedly prompt for it.
The way to trigger this feature is to use `ssh-add key-file`.
It is also possible to specify a timeout period (lifetime) for how long to remember the passphrase, using the `-t` flag.

#### Customizing SSH keys names
It is possible to specify the name of the file where to store the keys when generating them.
By default ssh will search for predefined file names, such as `id_ed25519` or `id_rsa`.
But if we are using a different name, then we should indicate ssh which file we are using as keys.
For doing so, we will use the `-i` flag followed by the location (which is also standardized under `$HOME/.ssh`)
and the actual filename. E.g.
```sh
# ssh using specific key file
ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/USER_clusterX_ed25519 USERNAME@clusterX.IP.address
```


#### Configuration Details
The preevious process can be simplified even a bit more, by adding some of theese details to the configuration file used by ssh.
Such a configuration file resides in the `$HOME/.ssh/` directory and is named `config`.
An example of an entry in this file is shown below,

##### Single Host
```sh
HOST clusterX
     HostName clusterX.IP.address
     User USERNAME
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/USER_clusterX_ed25519
```

##### Multiple Hosts
One could even envision the possibility of including mutliple hosts by adding
entries in the `~/.ssh/config` file.
```sh
HOST clusterX
     HostName clusterX.IP.address
     User USERNAMEonclusterX
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/USER_clusterX_ed25519

HOST clusterY
     HostName clusterY.IP.address
     User USERNAMEonclusterY
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/USER_clusterY_ed25519

HOST clusterZ
     HostName clusterZ.IP.address
     User USERNAMEonclusterZ
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/USER_clusterZ_ed25519
```
in this way, the user would just use the commands `ssh clusterX` or `ssh clusterY` for connecting to any of the corresponding remote systems.


## Troubleshooting Keys Configurations
A couple of options to consider when finding troubles with the keys setup in a remote system can be generically considered.

Firstly, if for what ever reason the ssh-copy-id command is not found or available in the local system where the keys were generated, an alternative way to transfer the public key to the remote system could be achieved by using the following command,
```sh
cat $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh USERNAME@remote.system.ip "cat >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```
this assumes that the public key named `id_ed25519.pub` is located at `$HOME/.ssh/` directory and it will be placed in the `remote.system.ip` space of a user named `USERNAME`.


### Permission Attributes
Another issue that may arise when transferring the private keys, is related to an improper setup of the file permissions. The `$HOME/.ssh` directory must only be accessible by the owner, and the various key files must not be writable (or in some cases, readable) by anyone else. This is how the `$HOME/.ssh` directory should look like,

```sh
# look at ~/.ssh permissions
ls -ld $HOME/.ssh

drwx------ 2 USERNAME GROUPNAME 7 Aug  9 15:43 /home/USERNAME/.ssh
```

To fix improper set permissions, the following command may be used:
```sh
# fix permissions in ~/.ssh
chmod -R go= $HOME/.ssh/
```


## Debugging/Verbose Mode
Additionally, if we find problems when trying to ssh into a system which we either know the authentication procedure (either keys, password, or MFA) is not behaving or working as expected, we can use the following options when using the ssh command to obtain more verbose detail of the connections,
```sh
# -v activates the "verbose mode": resulting in printing debugging messages
# helpful in diagnosing connection, authentication, and configuration problems
# Multiple -v options increase the verbosity, the maximum is 3.

ssh -v USERNAME@remote.system.ip
ssh -vv USERNAME@remote.system.ip
ssh -vvv USERNAME@remote.system.ip
```


##  ControlMaster -- multiplexing 

ssh has an option called `ControlMaster` that enables the sharing of multiple sessions over one single network connection.
This means that you can connect to the remote system once, enter your credentials, and have all other subsequent ssh sessions utilizing the initial connection without need for re-authentication.
You can specify such options each time on the command line, but itâ€™s easiest if you put it in your ssh client configuration file so that it applies every time that a connection is launched to the corresponding system.
