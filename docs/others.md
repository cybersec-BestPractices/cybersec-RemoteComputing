Although not extrictely linked to *remote computing* many different aspects
in our day-to-day operations involve remote transfering of information, as well as, remote access, trust, etc.
Among one of the most relevant tools and commodities employed nowadays is eletronic-mail, e-mail.


## Email
In the same way that it is important to validate
the integrity and validity of our connections to remote systems, it would also be for other types
of communications, such as electronic messages, or email.
In particular, for *email* a tool called **Pretty Good Privacy** (PGP) can be used to ensure the confidentiality %of the messages exchanged, as well as validate the identity of the sender.
PGP is an encryption method that provides cryptographic
privacy and authentication for data communication.
The basic idea is to encrypt the communication (similar to how using *ssh-keys*
would do it) and sign it so that the message received at the other end of the
communication channel can be decrypted, validated and authenticated.
